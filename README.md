## Automate your day job with python

---

## Goal
In this activity, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

**Objectives:**

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Output:
